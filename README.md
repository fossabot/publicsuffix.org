The publicsuffix.org website

Nothing to see here; this is the source for the [https://publicsuffix.org](https://publicsuffix.org) website, so that the volunteers can maintain it.

If you are seeing this, and you are not one of the maintainers, you've taken a left turn where you should have turned right.  

You're likely looking for the [Public Suffix List](https://github.com/publicsuffix/list).
